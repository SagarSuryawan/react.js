                        REMOVE IRRELEVENT STUFF

from public folder = robot.txt,
from src folder =   setuptest.js,App.test.js, clear css from App.css and index.css,
from App.js = clear all content from div which className= "App"
as of now index.js is as it is.
in public folder index.htm, there element which id = "root".Exactly this Page is render in App. 

                        ANOTHER WAY TO SET UP REACT APP USING VITE (preferable)

vite do not install node modules by default.so you can do it youe own.
clear css from index.css and app.css
