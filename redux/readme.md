# What is Redux?
Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, commonly used with React. It helps manage and share state across the app in a predictable way.

Instead of passing props manually through multiple levels (prop drilling), Redux stores global state in a central store, making it accessible from anywhere in the application.
